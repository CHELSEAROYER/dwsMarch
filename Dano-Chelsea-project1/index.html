	<h1><em>List Of Choux Pastry Dishes</em></h1>
    <p>Choux pastry, or pâte à choux, is a light 
pastry dough that contains only butter, water,
flour and eggs. The high moisture content of 
the dough causes it to produce steam when cooked,
which puffs the pastry.</p>

		<h3>Tell Me More About Tradition</h3>
		<p>Beignets are commonly known in New Orleans 
as a breakfast served with powdered sugar on 
top.They are traditionally prepared right 
before consumption to be eaten fresh and hot. 
Variations of fried dough can be found across 
cuisines internationally; however, the origin 
of the term beignet is specifically French. 
In the United States, beignets have been popular 
within New Orleans Creole cuisine and are 
customarily served as a dessert or in some 
sweet variation. They were brought to New Orleans 
in the 18th century by French colonists, from "the 
old mother country", and became a large part of 
home-style Creole cooking, variations often 
including banana or plantain – popular fruits 
in the port city.</p>

	<h2>Bossche Bol</h2>
	<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bossche_bol">
For 50 years, Bossche bollen (chocoladebollen) 
are usually eaten as an accompaniment to 
coffee, etc., rather than as a dessert.
	</blockquote> 
	<p>It is effectively a large profiterole, about 12 
cm (5 in.) in diameter (i.e., somewhat larger than 
a tennis ball), filled with whipped cream and coated 
entirely or almost entirely with (usually dark) 
chocolate.</p>
	 		
	<p>They are traditionally eaten with the fingers, 
which can be quite messy. The best way to avoid 
spillage is by eating the pastry upside down, so 
that the hard layer of chocolate serves as a 
bottom. It is also possible (though frowned upon 
by traditionalists) to use a knife and fork.</p>

	<h2>Nun's Puffs</h2>
	<p><strong>Nun's farts</strong> (also euphemized 
as nun's puffs) are a dessert pastry originally 
from France,and now seen in French Canada, the 
United States,and England.</p>
								<!--add aside-->
	<aside>
  		<h3>Etymology</h3>
  		<p>The similarly-named French-Canadian
dessert pets de soeurs (literally 
"farts of [religious] sisters") 
is sometimes confused with this 
dessert, but actually is a completely 
different pastry.</p>
	</aside>
	<p> Nun's puffs is made from butter, milk, flour, 
sugar, eggs, and sometimes honey.Recipes call 
for pan frying (traditionally in lard), re-frying 
and then baking, or baking straight away. 
The best-established recipes suggest cooking the 
butter, milk, and flour in a pan then adding the 
eggs (whites last) and sprinkling sugar on the 
mixture before baking.Choux paste is also 
cooked twice, to prepare the paste and to 
"transform it into puffs". It dates to medieval 
times and is a cross between a batter and a dough.
A cream filling can also be inserted.</p>

	<h2>St. Honoré Cake</h2>
	<p>This classic French dessert is a circle of 
puff pastry at its base with a ring of pâte à 
choux piped on the outer edge. After the base 
is baked small cream puffs are dipped in 
caramelized sugar and attached side by side 
on top of the circle of the pâte à choux. 
This base is traditionally filled with crème 
chiboust and finished with whipped cream using 
a special St. Honoré piping tip.</p>
